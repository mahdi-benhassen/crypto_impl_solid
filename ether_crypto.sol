/* One example of a cryptocurrency implemented using Solidity is the Ethereum cryptocurrency itself, 
which is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. 
Solidity is the primary programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, 
and the code for the Ethereum cryptocurrency is implemented as a smart contract written in Solidity.

This smart contract implements a basic token with the ability to transfer tokens between addresses, 
approve other addresses to spend tokens on your behalf, 
and transfer tokens on behalf of someone else (with their approval). 
This can be used to implement a basic cryptocurrency with a fixed supply that can be traded between addresses on the Ethereum blockchain.

Here is an example of the basic structure of a Solidity smart contract that implements a cryptocurrency: /*

contract MyToken {
    string public name = "MyToken";
    string public symbol = "MTK";
    uint8 public decimals = 18;
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);

    constructor(uint256 initialSupply) {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] = initialSupply;
        totalSupply = initialSupply;
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public returns (bool success) {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= value);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= value;
        balanceOf[to] += value;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, value);
        return true;
    }

    function approve(address spender, uint256 value) public returns (bool success) {
        allowance[msg.sender][spender] = value;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, value);
        return true;
    }

    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) public returns (bool success) {
        require(value <= balanceOf[from]);
        require(value <= allowance[from][msg.sender]);
        balanceOf[from] -= value;
        balanceOf[to] += value;
        allowance[from][msg.sender] -= value;
        emit Transfer(from, to, value);
        return true;
    }
}
