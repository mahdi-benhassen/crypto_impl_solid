To integrate the token implemented using Solidity into a live blockchain, you would need to deploy the smart contract onto the blockchain. Here are the basic steps you would need to follow:

1. Choose a blockchain platform: There are several blockchain platforms that support smart contracts, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon. You would need to choose a platform that suits your needs based on factors such as cost, performance, and community support.

2. Write the smart contract code: Using Solidity, you would need to write the code for the token smart contract. The code would specify the name, symbol, decimals, and total supply of the token, as well as its functionality, such as the ability to transfer tokens between addresses.

3. Compile the smart contract: You would need to use a Solidity compiler to convert the smart contract code into bytecode that can be executed on the blockchain. The bytecode represents the compiled version of the smart contract that will be deployed onto the blockchain.

4. Deploy the smart contract: Using a blockchain development tool or platform, you would need to deploy the compiled smart contract onto the blockchain. This would involve paying a fee in cryptocurrency to the blockchain network to cover the cost of executing the code.

5. Interact with the token: Once the smart contract is deployed, the token would be available for use on the blockchain. Users can interact with the token by sending and receiving tokens, checking their token balance, and approving other addresses to spend tokens on their behalf.

It's important to note that deploying a smart contract onto a live blockchain requires a good understanding of blockchain technology and Solidity programming. It's recommended that you seek the guidance of an experienced blockchain developer or development team to help you with the deployment process.
