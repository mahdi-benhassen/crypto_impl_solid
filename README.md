To integrate the token implemented using Solidity into a live blockchain, you would need to deploy the smart contract onto the blockchain. Here are the basic steps you would need to follow:

1. Choose a blockchain platform: There are several blockchain platforms that support smart contracts, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon. You would need to choose a platform that suits your needs based on factors such as cost, performance, and community support.

2. Write the smart contract code: Using Solidity, you would need to write the code for the token smart contract. The code would specify the name, symbol, decimals, and total supply of the token, as well as its functionality, such as the ability to transfer tokens between addresses.

3. Compile the smart contract: You would need to use a Solidity compiler to convert the smart contract code into bytecode that can be executed on the blockchain. The bytecode represents the compiled version of the smart contract that will be deployed onto the blockchain.

4. Deploy the smart contract: Using a blockchain development tool or platform, you would need to deploy the compiled smart contract onto the blockchain. This would involve paying a fee in cryptocurrency to the blockchain network to cover the cost of executing the code.

5. Interact with the token: Once the smart contract is deployed, the token would be available for use on the blockchain. Users can interact with the token by sending and receiving tokens, checking their token balance, and approving other addresses to spend tokens on their behalf.

It's important to note that deploying a smart contract onto a live blockchain requires a good understanding of blockchain technology and Solidity programming. It's recommended that you seek the guidance of an experienced blockchain developer or development team to help you with the deployment process.

**To integrate a token implemented using Solidity into the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), you would need to follow these steps:

1. Set up a Binance Smart Chain wallet: You will need a Binance Smart Chain wallet to interact with the blockchain. You can use a web-based wallet like MetaMask, or a mobile wallet like Trust Wallet or TokenPocket.

2. Get some Binance Coin (BNB): You will need some BNB to pay for the gas fees associated with deploying the smart contract and interacting with the blockchain.

3. Write the Solidity smart contract: Using the Solidity programming language, you would need to write the code for the token smart contract. The code would specify the name, symbol, decimals, total supply, and functionality of the token.

4. Compile the smart contract: You would need to use a Solidity compiler to convert the smart contract code into bytecode that can be executed on the Binance Smart Chain.

5. Deploy the smart contract: You can deploy the smart contract using a blockchain development tool like Remix or Truffle. You would need to connect your wallet to the development tool and choose the BSC network. Then, you can deploy the compiled smart contract and pay the gas fees in BNB.

6. Interact with the token: Once the smart contract is deployed, the token would be available for use on the Binance Smart Chain. You can interact with the token using a blockchain explorer like BscScan. You can also use a wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet to send and receive the token.

To add the token to a decentralized exchange like PancakeSwap, you would need to create a liquidity pool by providing an equivalent value of the token and BNB. Once the liquidity pool is created, users can trade the token on PancakeSwap.

It's important to note that deploying a smart contract and interacting with the blockchain requires a good understanding of Solidity programming and blockchain technology. It's recommended that you seek the guidance of an experienced blockchain developer or development team to help you with the integration process.**
